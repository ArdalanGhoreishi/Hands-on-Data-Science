Task 1 involves the straightforward implementation of the concepts presented in the paper titled "Multiomics modeling of the immunome, transcriptome, microbiome, proteome, and metabolome adaptations during human pregnancy" authored by Ghaemi et al. in 2019. The primary objective is to leverage biological measurements for the characterization of physiological changes occurring during pregnancy. The authors employ a multifaceted approach, incorporating various modalities such as immune system metrics, microbiome data, and others. A key aspect of this task is exploring the potential to predict the gestational age of a mother exclusively based on the gathered biomarkers.

Task 2 revolves around examining potential factors contributing to anomalous outcomes in a binary classification task.

Task 3 delves into an intriguing scenario within a regression task. Here, two features exhibit significant importance for the model, evident in their coefficients surpassing 30. However, upon closer examination, these features reveal themselves as binary, mutually exclusive variables that almost entirely span the dataset. Despite their pervasive presence, these features individually display minimal correlation with the outcome. The unexpected twist lies in the fact that both features exhibit high importance for the model, and remarkably, both contribute positively. The puzzle deepens as we seek to understand the underlying dynamics at play.
