Task 1 involves the straightforward implementation of the concepts presented in the paper titled "Multiomics modeling of the immunome, transcriptome, microbiome, proteome, and metabolome adaptations during human pregnancy" authored by Ghaemi et al. in 2019. The primary objective is to leverage biological measurements for the characterization of physiological changes occurring during pregnancy. The authors employ a multifaceted approach, incorporating various modalities such as immune system metrics, microbiome data, and others. A key aspect of this task is exploring the potential to predict the gestational age of a mother exclusively based on the gathered biomarkers.

Task 2 revolves around examining potential factors contributing to anomalous outcomes in a binary classification task.
